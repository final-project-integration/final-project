Team:

Module Name / Main Class:



1. Purpose (High-level)

- One–two sentences max.

Respond here:



2. Entry Points (what Integration/MainMenu should call)

List ONLY the methods that other teams (ModuleHub/MainMenu) are supposed to use.

For each method:

Method 1
Signature:
public ReturnType methodName(Type1 arg1, Type2 arg2, ...)

- Reads/writes files? (which files, format)

Method 2
- Signature:
- Who calls it: do you need MainMenu or ModuleHub to call it

(Repeat for any other public methods Integration needs.)

Respond here:



3. Data / File Expectations

Respond here:




7. Minimal Test Scenario (for Integration to verify)

Describe 1 simple test we can run to confirm your module works:

- Given:(example input/file + parameters)
- Call: (exact method call we should make)  
  example——>reports.generateYearlySummary(2024)
- Expected result:(what we should see in console / return value)
