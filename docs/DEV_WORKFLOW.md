#  Developer Workflow Guide

Welcome to the project! This guide explains **how to work in our GitHub repo**, create branches, and submit your code smoothly. Scroll to the bottom for a  30 second ‚ÄúI forgot Git, save me‚Äù panic guide.

##  Branch Rules

| Rule                  | Meaning                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `main` is protected   | Nobody pushes straight to `main`                    |
| No direct commits     | All changes must go through Pull Requests           |
| CODEOWNERS required   | Integration & teammates must review certain changes |
| Module branches exist | Each team has its own working branch                |

---

##  Branch Naming

###  Permanent module branches

| Module      | Branch                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Accounts    | `accounts`                  |
| Storage     | `storage`                   |
| Validation  | `validation`                |
| Reports     | `reports`                   |
| Prediction  | `prediction`                |
| Test        | `test`                      |
| Integration | `integration`               |

>  **Never develop directly on these module branches.**
> They are like ‚Äúparking lots‚Äù for features.

##  Your Development Workflow

### 1. Clone repo once

```bash
git clone https://github.com/final-project-integration/final-project.git
cd final-project
```

---

### 2. Switch to your team branch

```bash
git checkout accounts   # example: if you're on Accounts team
```

Substitute with your module (`storage`, `reports`, etc.)

---

### 3. Create your own feature branch

Format:

```
<module>/feat-<short-feature-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b accounts/feat-register
```

---

### 4. Work ‚Üí stage ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(accounts): implement register workflow"
git push -u origin accounts/feat-register
```

>  Include module name in commit messages:
> `feat(storage): load CSV file`

---

### 5. Open Pull Request (PR)

* **Base branch:** `main`
* **Compare branch:** your feature branch
  (example: `accounts/feat-register`)

---

### 6. Request review

Required:

‚úÖ 1 teammate review
‚úÖ Integration approval if API/signatures change

PR template will guide you.

---

### 7. Merge PR

Once approved, click **Merge Pull Request**.

 Done: your code is now part of the project.

---

##  Keeping your branch updated

If other teams merge work, update before coding:

```bash
git checkout accounts
git pull origin main
```

Then switch back to your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout accounts/feat-register
git merge accounts
```



##  Need Help?

Use these first:

* `docs/ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md` ‚Äî new member checklist
* `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` ‚Äî shared method signatures
* Ask your **team lead**
* Tag **@ditto-d** **@Darxware** **@Aaron-Madou** **@Kapil-Tamang** for Integration questions

---

##  Golden Rule

> **No one breaks another team‚Äôs code.**

If unsure ‚Üí ask before merging.
We ship as a team.

### Check branch

```
git branch
```

### Switch branches

```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Update local main

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Update your feature branch with latest main

```
git checkout <my-branch>
git merge main
```

### Save changes, commit, push

```
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

### Made changes on the wrong branch

Save work:

```
git stash
```

Switch:

```
git checkout <correct-branch>
```

Bring changes back:

```
git stash pop
```

### Create a new branch

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Undo last commit but keep changes

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Undo last commit and discard changes (irreversible)

```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Check file status and diffs

```
git status
git diff
```

### Show remote branches

```
git branch -r
```

---

## Emergency Reset Procedure

If unsure what happened, run:

```
git stash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

This returns you to a clean working state without losing work.

## Key Rules

| Goal            | Command                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Update project  | `git pull origin main`                  |
| Save progress   | `git add .` ‚Üí `git commit` ‚Üí `git push` |
| Switch branches | `git checkout <branch>`                 |
| Create branch   | `git checkout -b <branch>`              |

### Remember

> When confused: stash ‚Üí switch to main ‚Üí pull ‚Üí breathe
